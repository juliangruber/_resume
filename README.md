# resume

this is the notable creative stuff I've done in chronologically descending order (might not be up-to-date).

## chnnls.net

WIP - This is about creating a social network, that

* replaces all the others (channels can have restrictions on content types)
* respects privacy, users own their data
* is not censorable
* has as few centralized parts as possible and thus scales very well

For more, read [channel based networks](https://gist.github.com/4143091)

## jilla

Geeking up JIRA by writing an efficient-to-use cli interface for it.

Ever wished, you could:

```bash
$ jilla ls
WDSERVICE-78 <jgruber>  !! LessLinter
PS-656       <jgruber>  !! Graphite installieren
PS-480       <pkostoff>  ! Trailing stops
```

This also does time loggin, search, resolve/close/etc.

## collab-tunes

I started this with the idea to create a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) that runs in browsers and allows for easy
collaboration.

However this soon became way too complex for one person to do after work, so it's on pause.

The drum editor:
